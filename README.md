## Introduction
**Projects Aim**: This was a project prompt from Codecademy called "Excursion". The idea was to create a landing page for an up-and-coming phone app. We were provided a wire-frame, the images, and video with specifications on font sizes and colors.
Other than that, we were to create the HTML and CSS entirely on our own. 

## Technologies
The things that I used to build this landing page were:
  * VSCode
  * HTML5
  * CSS
  * Git CMD
  * Images and video provided by Codecademy
## Status
This project is marked as complete.
